# Chatbot Project using Gemini 1.5 Flash API, Langchain, and Streamlit

This project is a **Chatbot** powered by the **Gemini 1.5 Flash API**, using the **Langchain framework** for advanced natural language processing and **Streamlit** to create an interactive web interface. The chatbot processes user input, provides meaningful and context-aware responses, and supports multiple conversation types.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash API to process and understand user queries.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Instant responses provided through the user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains context across the conversation for a more natural, human-like experience.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Clean, interactive web interface to easily chat with the bot.
- **Extensible**: Built in a modular way, making it easy to extend with new features or integrate with other models and services.

## How It Works

1. **Start Chat**:
   - Users open the Streamlit web interface to initiate a conversation.

2. **Gemini API Processing**:
   - The user’s input is processed via the Gemini 1.5 Flash API to generate a response.

3. **Data Flow through LangChain**:
   - LangChain manages the flow of data, executing custom logic for generating structured responses.

4. **Display Results**:
   - The chatbot’s response is displayed in real-time on the Streamlit dashboard.
